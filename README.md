# APITestProject

Sprint - Start

During this sprint we set out to build the API Test Framework. Our chosen API is a online movie database which returns the following results when given a valid movie title. From this we could build our model response from each API call and then format responses to get each individual piece of information. As well as, perform checks for the rating, actors or genres on the movie.
